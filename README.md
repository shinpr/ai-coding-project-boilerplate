## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Create your project
npx create-ai-project my-project

# 2. Install dependencies (automatic)
cd my-project && npm install

# 3. Launch Claude Code and configure
claude                    # Launch Claude Code
/project-inject          # Set up project prerequisites (read every session by AI)
/implement <your feature> # Start building!
```

> 💡 **First time?** Check the [Quick Start Guide](docs/guides/en/quickstart.md) for detailed setup instructions

## 🔄 Updating Existing Projects

Keep your project's agent definitions, commands, skills, and AI rules up to date. Run from your project's root directory:

```bash
# Preview changes without applying
npx create-ai-project update --dry-run

# Apply updates
npx create-ai-project update
```

### How It Works

When you run `npx create-ai-project update`, the CLI:

1. Checks your project's `.create-ai-project.json` manifest for the current version
2. Compares it with the latest package version
3. Shows the CHANGELOG for review
4. Replaces managed files with the latest versions
5. Regenerates active directories for your language setting

### What Gets Updated

| Target | Path |
|--------|------|
| Agent definitions | `.claude/agents-{lang}/` |
| Command definitions | `.claude/commands-{lang}/` |
| Skill definitions | `.claude/skills-{lang}/` |
| AI rules | `CLAUDE.{lang}.md` |

Your source code (`src/`), `package.json`, and other project files are never touched.

### Protecting Customized Files

If you've customized a file and don't want it overwritten:

```bash
# Add to ignore list
npx create-ai-project update --ignore skills project-context
npx create-ai-project update --ignore agents task-executor
npx create-ai-project update --ignore commands implement
npx create-ai-project update --ignore CLAUDE.md

# Remove from ignore list
npx create-ai-project update --unignore skills project-context
```

Ignored files are preserved during updates. Note that ignoring files may cause version mismatch with other updated components.

### First Run on Existing Projects

If your project was created before the update feature, just run `npx create-ai-project update` from your project's root directory. It will automatically initialize the manifest by detecting your language from `.claudelang`.

## 🚀 Beyond Vibe Coding: Why Sub Agents?

As teams move beyond vibe coding, **agentic coding** — delegating structured workflows to specialized AI agents — is becoming the professional standard. This boilerplate implements that approach with Claude Code sub-agents:

**Traditional AI coding struggles with:**
- ❌ Losing context in long sessions
- ❌ Declining code quality over time
- ❌ Frequent session restarts for large tasks

**Sub agents solve this through context engineering:**
- ✅ Splitting work into specialized roles (design, implementation, review)
- ✅ Each agent gets fresh, focused context — no exhaustion
- ✅ Handling large projects without degradation

This works because Claude Code's sub-agent mechanism runs each agent in its own context window. The parent session delegates tasks, and each sub-agent starts with a clean, focused context. Quality checks (lint, type check, test, build) run locally before each commit — not in CI. The feedback loop stays fast, and code is already verified when it's pushed.

## 🎨 Skills System

This boilerplate provides the principles used in agentic implementation workflows as skills, making them available for reference in everyday tasks as needed.

### Applied Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `coding-standards` | Universal coding principles, anti-patterns, debugging |
| `typescript-rules` | TypeScript type safety, async patterns, refactoring |
| `typescript-testing` | Vitest, TDD, coverage requirements |
| `documentation-criteria` | PRD, ADR, Design Doc standards |
| `technical-spec` | Architecture, environment, build commands |
| `implementation-approach` | Strategy patterns, task decomposition |
| `integration-e2e-testing` | Integration/E2E test design, ROI-based selection |
| `project-context` | Project-specific prerequisites for AI accuracy (set via `/project-inject`) |

**Frontend-specific skills** are also available under `frontend/` (e.g., `frontend/typescript-rules`).

## 🤖 Claude Code Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements] --> B[Scale Detection]
    B -->|Small| C[Direct Implementation]
    B -->|Medium| D[Design → Implementation]
    B -->|Large| E[PRD → Design → Implementation]

    C --> F[Quality Check → Commit]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

### Reverse Engineering Workflow

Generate PRD and Design Docs from existing code:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Phase1[Phase 1: PRD Generation]
        CMD["/reverse-engineer"] --> SD[scope-discoverer unified]
        SD --> PRD[prd-creator]
        PRD --> CV1[code-verifier]
        CV1 --> DR1[document-reviewer]
    end

    subgraph Phase2[Phase 2: Design Doc Generation]
        TD[technical-designer] --> CV2[code-verifier]
        CV2 --> DR2[document-reviewer]
        DR2 --> DONE[Complete]
    end

    DR1 --> |"All PRDs Approved (reuse scope)"| TD
```

### How It Works

1. **Requirement Analysis**: `/implement` command analyzes task scale
2. **Document Generation**: Creates necessary docs (PRD, Design Doc, Work Plan)
3. **Task Execution**: Specialized agents handle each phase
4. **Quality Assurance**: Automatic testing, type checking, and fixes
5. **Commit & Continue**: Clean commits for each completed task

## 🔧 Package Manager Configuration

This boilerplate uses npm by default, but you can switch to your preferred package manager like bun or pnpm.

There are two environment-dependent settings in `package.json`:

- **`packageManager`**: The package manager and version to use
- **`scripts`**: The execution commands for each script

When you change these, Claude Code will recognize them and execute with the appropriate commands.

### Switching to bun

```json
{
  "packageManager": "bun@1.3.3",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bun run tsc && tsc-alias",
    "dev": "bun run src/index.ts",
    "test": "bun test",
    "check": "bunx @biomejs/biome check src",
    "check:all": "bun run check && bun run lint && bun run format:check && bun run check:unused && bun run check:deps && bun run build && bun test"
  }
}
```

The above are representative examples. The following scripts are referenced in skills and sub-agent definitions. Update them as needed:

`build`, `build:frontend`, `dev`, `preview`, `type-check`, `test`, `test:coverage`, `test:coverage:fresh`, `test:safe`, `cleanup:processes`, `check`, `check:fix`, `check:code`, `check:unused`, `check:deps`, `check:all`, `format`, `format:check`, `lint`, `lint:fix`

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

Full support for English and Japanese:

```bash
npm run lang:en         # Switch to English
npm run lang:ja         # Switch to Japanese
npm run lang:status     # Check current language
```

Automatically updates all configurations, rules, and agent definitions.

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: How do sub agents work?**  
A: Just use `/implement` or `/task`. The right agents activate automatically.

**Q: What if there are errors?**  
A: quality-fixer auto-fixes most issues. If not, it provides clear instructions.

**Q: Can I customize for my project?**
A: Yes! Run `/project-inject` to set up project-specific prerequisites. This information is read by AI at the start of every session to improve execution accuracy.

**Q: What's the typical workflow?**
A: `/project-inject` (once) → `/implement` (features) → auto quality checks → commit

**Q: How is this different from Copilot/Cursor?**
A: Those help write code. This manages entire development lifecycle with specialized agents.

**Q: What is agentic coding and how does this boilerplate support it?**
A: Agentic coding delegates structured workflows to specialized AI agents instead of relying on conversational prompting. This boilerplate provides pre-configured sub-agents, CLAUDE.md rules, and quality checks so you can adopt that approach without building the scaffolding yourself.

**Q: How does this prevent context exhaustion?**
A: Through context engineering. Each sub-agent runs in its own context window focused on a single responsibility, so context stays fresh regardless of session length. We've run 770K+ token sessions without quality degradation — details in the [design philosophy post](https://dev.to/shinpr/zero-context-exhaustion-building-production-ready-ai-coding-teams-with-claude-code-sub-agents-31b).
