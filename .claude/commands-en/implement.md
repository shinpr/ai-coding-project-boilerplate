description: Manage complete cycle from requirement analysis to implementation as orchestrator
---

Based on @docs/guides/sub-agents.md, act as an orchestrator.

Requirements: $ARGUMENTS

**Think deeply** Think deeply about the requirements and first engage in dialogue to clarify requirements, making the following clear:
- Issues to solve or values to realize
- Expected usage scenarios and scale
- Technical constraints and prerequisites

Once requirements are moderately clarified, proceed with the following workflow:
1. Requirement analysis with requirement-analyzer
2. Task decomposition with TodoWrite (**start of mandatory execution process**)
3. Mandatory consultation with rule-advisor at each task start
4. Metacognition → Implementation → Quality check
5. Appropriately control and complete work from analysis through implementation completion

Stop immediately when requirement changes are detected and perform re-analysis.
