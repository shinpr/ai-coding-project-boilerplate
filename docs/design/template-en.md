# [Feature Name] Design Document

## Overview

[Explain the purpose and overview of this feature in 2-3 sentences]

## Background and Context

### Problem to Solve

[Specific problems or challenges this feature aims to solve]

### Current Challenges

[Problems or limitations in the current system]

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

- [List mandatory functional requirements]

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: [Requirements for response time, throughput, etc.]
- **Scalability**: [Requirements for handling increased load]
- **Reliability**: [Requirements for error rate, availability, etc.]
- **Maintainability**: [Code understandability, ease of modification]

## Acceptance Criteria

Define specific and verifiable conditions to determine successful implementation for each functional requirement.
These conditions serve as the basis for test cases and are used to objectively determine implementation completion.

- [ ] [Specific acceptance criteria for functional requirement 1]
  - Example: "When a user clicks the login button, authentication succeeds with valid credentials"
  - Example: "When invalid credentials are provided, an appropriate error message is displayed"
- [ ] [Specific acceptance criteria for functional requirement 2]
  - Example: "The data list screen displays items paginated by 10 entries"
  - Example: "When text is entered in the search field, results are filtered in real-time"

## Design

### Architecture Overview

[How this feature is positioned within the overall system]

### Data Flow

```
[Express data flow using diagrams or pseudocode]
```

### Major Components

#### Component 1

- **Responsibilities**: [Scope of responsibility for this component]
- **Interface**: [APIs or type definitions provided]
- **Dependencies**: [Relationships with other components]

#### Component 2

- **Responsibilities**: [Scope of responsibility for this component]
- **Interface**: [APIs or type definitions provided]
- **Dependencies**: [Relationships with other components]

### Type Definitions

```typescript
// Key type definitions here
```

### Error Handling

[Types of errors and how to handle them]

### Logging and Monitoring

[What to log and how to monitor]

## Implementation Plan

### Phased Approach

1. **Phase 1**: [What to implement first]
2. **Phase 2**: [What to implement next]
3. **Phase 3**: [What to implement last]

### Migration Strategy

[Migration approach from existing system, backward compatibility considerations, etc.]

## Testing Strategy

### Test Design Principles

Automatically derive test cases from acceptance criteria:
- Create at least one test case for each acceptance criterion
- Implement measurable criteria from acceptance criteria as assertions

### Unit Tests

[Unit testing approach and coverage goals]
- Verify individual elements of functional acceptance criteria

### Integration Tests

[Integration testing approach and important test cases]
- Verify combined behavior of functional acceptance criteria

### End-to-End Tests

[E2E testing approach]
- Verify complete scenarios from acceptance criteria
- Confirm functional behavior from user perspective

### Performance Tests

[Performance testing methods and criteria]
- Verify performance benchmarks from non-functional acceptance criteria

## Security Considerations

[Security concerns and countermeasures]

## Future Extensibility

[Considerations for future feature additions or changes]
