### Problem to Solve

[Specific problems or challenges this feature aims to solve]

### Current Challenges

[Problems or limitations in the current system]

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

- [List mandatory functional requirements]

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: [Requirements for response time, throughput, etc.]
- **Scalability**: [Requirements for handling increased load]
- **Reliability**: [Requirements for error rate, availability, etc.]
- **Maintainability**: [Code understandability, ease of modification]

## Acceptance Criteria

Define specific and verifiable conditions for determining successful implementation of each functional requirement.
These conditions serve as the basis for test cases and are used to objectively judge implementation completion.
(Note: Checkboxes remain empty at design time since implementation is not yet complete)

- [ ] [Specific acceptance criteria for functional requirement 1]
  - Example: "When user clicks login button, authentication succeeds with correct credentials"
  - Example: "When invalid credentials are entered, appropriate error message displays"
- [ ] [Specific acceptance criteria for functional requirement 2]
  - Example: "In data list screen, pagination displays 10 items per page"
  - Example: "When typing in search field, real-time filtering occurs"
